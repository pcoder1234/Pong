# Pong
 A pong game that uses Python and Pygame, written in only 160 lines of code!
 Hope you enjoy!
 The game can be easily modified to a 2-player format, however by default this is a one player game played against a basic ai.
 You are the player on the right
 Have fun :)

 **DISCLAIMER**
 You may encounter a ModuleNotFound Error, and that is because Pygame is not installed on your device.
 To install Pygame, go to your Command Prompt or Terminal and type the following: pip install pygame
